I and my teammates: Danielle Annecston, Cathleen Cusachs, Danilo Martinez, and Xiner Zhang designed this [[website]](https://2021.philemerge.com/b_group4/) for the "Paper Bag Mask Foundation" in the course “User-Producers 2.0: Developing Interactivity” at BU. We mainly used the html, css, and the WordPress.
