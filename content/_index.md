 Welcome to my webpage!

I am Yanling Zhao(赵燕玲), a second-year master student majoring in Emerging Media Studies at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/)'s [College of Communication](https://www.bu.edu/com/). 

My research interests focus on employing computational methods combined with surveys and experiments to study the political communication, mis/disinformation, and media effects in the digital media era. More specifically, my research aims to explore the following research questions: (1) How dose digital media or technology take the effect on shaping public opinion or political behaviors? (2a) Who is the actor behind in generating and spreading mis/disinformation online, (2b) and which mechanisms could combat mis/disinformation circulation? (3) Whether and how mass media and news still affect people’s perceptions, attitudes, and public opinion both online and offline in the digital media era? 

I got the M.A. in Chinese Culture from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (Hong Kong) in 2017, B.A. in Journalism and Communication & B.B.A. in Accounting from [Xihua University](http://www.xhu.edu.cn/) (Sichuan, China) in 2016. Prior to the BU, I worked as a commentator and senior editor at the [Hong Kong Commercial Daily](http://www.hkcd.com/) for four years.
