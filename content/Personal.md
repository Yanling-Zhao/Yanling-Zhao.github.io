Beyond academia, I love travelling all around the globe, photography, and running, I am a new violin learner! I am a big fan of soccer ball player "Lionel Messi" and Argentina National Football Team for more than 17 years, have been following them to the Rusia and Qatar to watch their FIFA world cup matches, one of my dreams is to travel around the world to watch their world cup games every four years until I can not take flight... I'd like to share some incredibal photos I took here in the future...
